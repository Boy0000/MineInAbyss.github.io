The skybox consists of many renders of different sections stitched together to create this neat effect! Currently, it only works up to the second layer.

### Installation

- Download the skybox below.
- Put it into your resourcepacks folder, and **make sure you have [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) installed**!
- Change the following settings: 
    - `Options > Video Settings > Quality > Custom Sky: ON`
    - `Options > Video Settings > Details > Sky: OFF`
- Some shaders may disable the skybox.
