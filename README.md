# MineInAbyss website
A site for information about the Mine In Abyss project. It is based on the [HardCandy-Jekyll](https://github.com/xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll) theme, with a few modifications like the top down render of Orth on the frontpage, or social media buttons. We additionally use [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.
